Controller => Api endPoint (Postman intraction)

Repositories => Database (it extends the JPA repo)
             => benifit of using JPA it provides interface that we can use easily

@Autowired --> is helping us to connecting with different layers

3 ways to communicate with JPA
   1. Already defind method(save,findAll,get)
   2. No query needed defined method and use it
   3. write query and use it
